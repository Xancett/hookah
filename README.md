Project is a group of various scripts fit together to show a complete picture of a web application.

## Part 1 - Data

Starting with Python the script will scrap a website / websites for data regarding shisha from various companies. I'll organize this data to fit in a mongodb.

## Part 2 - API

Using AWS I'll create an API for retrieving data from the DB organized by the previous script.

## Part 3 - Web app

Next is a web app designed to search and view shisha from the previous API. Web app should allow for searching shisha. Next the web app should have a basic 'login' type system that allows for adding shisha to different lists (want to smoke, not interested in, have smoked, etc) along with a rating system and recommendations based on what the user has smoked previously.
